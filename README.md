A 32-bit ARM-compatible instruction set emulator/interpreter written in C++

The original plan was to create and implement my own instruction set, but I decided to go for an A32-compatible system first.

*It is not perfect*
--
Don't expect it to have all the exact same details of execution, memory, etc any time soon.
If that bothers you, contribute! Make it faster or more exact or whatever!

*It's intended for simple educational use*
--
Preferably as an ASM learning assistant -- that's how I'm using it!
